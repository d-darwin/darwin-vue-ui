## DARWIN Studio UI Library

### What is it?
It's lightweight and performant UI Library for Vue 3. 
Just check out [Bundlephobia report](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=@darwin-studio/ui-vue).

ðŸš§ DISCLAIMER: Under construction. Not even close to alpha. So please, don't use in production.

### Key features
- Components created by [Brad Frost's Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) methodology, so you can go along with it creating and maintaining your Design System.  
- Design tokens represented to customize component appearance.    
- Build in optional reset style.
- Build in optional fonts.
- Icon set agnostic.
- Uses focus-visible polyfill to emulate :focus-visible CSS prop.

âš  WARNING: Components of the library have to be compiled with sass-loader, so you need to have sass-loader package as a dev dependency. 

### Installation
```shell script
npm i @darwin-studio/ui-vue
npm i -D sass-loader sass
```  

### Basic Usage
```vue
<template>
  <!--...-->
  <DTypography :content="htmlString" />
  <!-- or -->
  <DTypography>
    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
  </DTypography>
  <!--...-->
</template>

<script>
import { DTypography } from "@darwin-studio/ui-vue"

export default {
  //...
  components: {
    DTypography
  },

  data() {
    return {
      htmlString: '<p>Content prop can contains <b>any HTML string.</b></p>'
    }
  }
  //...
}
</script>

<style>
/* By convention root element of all components has eponymous class name. */
.d-typography {
  /* You can override css custom props to redefine design tokens on runtime. */
  --text: #222;
  --general-font-size: 16px;
  --general-line-height: 24px;
  --general-font-weight: bold;
}
</style>
```   

### Documentation

For now there isn't any fancy documentation site to check out, 
but we are planing to use Storybook for the documentation when it will be integrated with Vue 3.   
You can find particular component documentation in its source code.

#### Design Tokens  

Feel free to customize default appearance of the components by 
redefining design tokens either in build time via SCSS variables or 
in runtime via CSS custom properties. 
You can even import design token to your *.js files. 
Check out what you can redefine in '@dariwn-studio/ui-vue/src/assets/styles/tokens'.

#### Reset styles  

Just add following line into your general scss file to reset all browser-specific styles.
```scss
@import "@darwin-studio/ui-vue/src/assets/styles/reset";
```

#### Fonts  

You can easily add to your project one of the popular open source custom font by adding following line. 
```scss
@import "@darwin-studio/ui-vue/src/assets/styles/fonts/[font-family-name]";
```

#### Icons  

We don't want to stick with one of icon sets, so decided allow you to choose one yourself.  
To do so just use [@iconify/vue](https://docs.iconify.design/implementations/vue/) package or any you prefer.
